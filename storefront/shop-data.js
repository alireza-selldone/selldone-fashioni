   Two quirks worth knowing, both found by testing rather than reading:

   1. `blog_id` on the detail route is the article's `parent_id` (the shop-blog
      record), NOT the article id. Passing the article id returns "Blog not
      found", which reads like the endpoint is missing.
   2. `?extra=true` returns the category list but an EMPTY `articles` array,
      filling `last_articles` instead. So categories and articles need separate
      calls rather than one combined one.

   The public list carries no category on each article. Rather than fetch the
   detail of every post to find out (an N+1 that grows with the blog), the
   category map is built with one filtered list call per category — bounded by
   the number of categories, which stays small. */
