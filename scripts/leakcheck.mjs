/* Does any shop-specific value survive in storefront/ ?
 *
 * The runtime can behave perfectly and the source still carry one shop's
 * values — which resurface the moment someone edits the code rather than
 * running `npm run setup`. This scans the storefront source for category ids,
 * product ids, the shop id and brand copy strings.
 *
 * shop.config.json is excluded on purpose: it IS the place those values live.
 * dist/ is excluded because it is generated from the config.
 *
 * A negative control runs every time. A scan that cannot go red produces
 * confidence and nothing else.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/leakcheck.mjs
